                           * 5. Frontend Integration Notes
                           * Backend must be ready to accept frontend requests once files are provided

                           * Enable CORS for frontend connection

                           * All lead-fetching, filtering, and report generation should work directly from the frontend UI

                           * Do not start integrating until frontend files are provided

                                 * 7. Important 
Backend must use OpenCorporates API as the primary data source
                                 1. Frontend integration is mandatory for project completion

                                 2. Backend must be fully functional before SEO and marketing can push live

                                 3. Security and performance best practices are required
